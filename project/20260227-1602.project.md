# Project: HotSpot

HotSpot is a social media platform with new ways for users to connect with one another and promote themselves.

## The Main Idea

This social media platform has a concept called "Zones".

### Zones

A **Zone** is essentially a section/domain of the app. For example, a "Social" zone is where users can create posts, and a "Business" zone is where users can create business profiles and promote their products/services. Similar to how Instagram has different sections for different types of content, HotSpot has different zones for different types of content and activities.

### Spots

A **Spot** is a user's instance of a **Zone**. For example, a user can have a "Social" spot and a "Business" spot - basically their profile in each zone.


## Mission Statement

To create an MVP of HotSpot with 1 zone (Social).



## Vision Statement

To be the go-to social media platform for users to connect with one another and promote themselves. To allow users high, intuitive control over their data, privacy, and the content they see.
