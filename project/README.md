# Project: HotSpot

This directory contains the project for HotSpot. Each file in this directory is an addendum to the project, with the exception of the README.md and where the first file is the initial version and last file is the latest version. Each file is named in the format YYYYMMDD-HHMM.project.md - files should be sorted in ascending order by date and are treated as immutable. This is to keep track of the project over time and to allow for easy reference to previous project states.

The `project` documents are the high level, business level documents that outline the project. They are not intended to be used for implementation, but rather for understanding the project and its goals.
