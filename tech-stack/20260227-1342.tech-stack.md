# Tech Stack: HotSpot

## Infrastructure

- Deployed on AWS
    - SES for email
    - S3 for storage
    - RDS for database
    - VPC for networking
    - Route 53 for DNS
    - CloudFront for CDN
    - API Gateway for API
    - SQS for message queue
    - SNS for notifications
    - ECS for container orchestration
    - ECR for container registry
    - EKS for Kubernetes (devops and CI/CD, environment management)
    - Auto Scaling Groups for horizontal scaling
    - Load Balancers for load balancing
    - etc


## Third Party Services

- Twilio for SMS (in areas where SNS is not feasible)
- 



## Architecture

### Mobile App
Framework: Expo
Language: TypeScript
UI Framework: Gluestack


### Front-End

#### Architecture
- Micro Front-End (MFE) architecture
    - There is a top level app that is the main "shell"
    - Each zone is a separate "host" app within the main shell
    - Within each host app, there are multiple "mfe" components.
    - MFEs are lazy loaded on demand and are self-contained.
    - MFEs are decoupled from the shell and each other.
    - MFEs are deployed independently.
    - MFEs are built as web components that inject into hosts, which are then loaded into the main shell.

#### Technology Stack
Framework: Angular
Language: TypeScript
CSS: SCSS
UI Framework: Tailwind CSS

#### Testing
- Unit Tests
- e2e Tests (using Playwright)

#### Deployment
- S3 for static assets
- CloudFront for CDN


### Back-End
Language: Java
Database: PostgreSQL
Cache: Redis
Framework: Spring Boot

#### Design
- Layered architecture
    - Controller Layer
    - Service Layer
    - Data/Repository Layer (Spring Data JPA)
- SOLID design principles
    - Clean Architecture
    - Use interfaces for implementations that can be swapped out (e.g. different email sending capabilities)
    - Use dependency injection
    - Use dependency inversion
- Unit Tests
- API Tests
    - Component Tests (mocked dependencies)
    - Integration Tests (real dependencies)


#### Deployment
- Container Orchestration
    - ECS for container orchestration
    - ECR for container registry
- CI/CD
    - Jenkins for CI/CD within management account to deploy to DEV/QA/PROD


#### DevOps

DevOps is handled in the management account. Should include (but not limited to):

- AWS Management Account
    - AWS Organizations
        - Root
        - Management
        - DEV
        - QA
        - PROD
- Jenkins for CI/CD within management account to deploy to DEV/QA/PROD
    - Jenkins deployed using ECS fargate, ECR, and EFS
- GitHub for version control
- Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager
- Security Scanning
    - SonarQube
    - Snyk
    - Trivy
- Logging
    - CloudWatch
- Observability
    - CloudWatch
    - CloudWatch Alarms for alerting
