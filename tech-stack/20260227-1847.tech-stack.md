## Updates: Front End Architecture

- There should be a main `shell` (Main Shell App) that encompasses the entire app. This includes the:
    - Navigation/Router logic for the following:
        - `/` (User Entry mfe)
        - `/login` (User Entry mfe)
        - `/signup` (User Entry mfe)
        - `/profile` (User Profile mfe)
        - `/settings(.*)` (User Settings mfe)
        - `/privacy(.*)` (User Privacy mfe)
        - `/zones(.*)`
            - `/zones/social(.*)` (Social Zone host mfe)


### Organization of MFEs

MFEs should be small enough to be easily maintainable and scalable but also covers closely related features. For example, there is a `User Entry` MFE that handles the home/welcome page, login and signup flows.


### Deployment

- All MFEs/UI apps deploy to AWS S3, separated as nested folders/paths
- There is a a single CloudFront distribution that points to the S3 bucket
