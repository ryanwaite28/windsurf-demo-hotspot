# Changelog: 2026-02-28 13:27 EST

## Summary

Implemented the frontend for the **Social Zone** spec — feed, thread creation/viewing, thread interactions, and comments.

## Changes

### Social Zone MFE (`/zones/social`)
- **FeedComponent**: displays paginated feed of threads from followed users, compose thread at top, load more pagination
- **ComposeThreadComponent**: reactive form with content textarea, 500-char limit, post button
- **ThreadCardComponent** (reusable): renders thread with author info, avatar, content, media, polls, quoted threads, type badges (repost/quote), pinned indicator, time-ago display
- **ThreadDetailComponent**: full thread view with comments section, inline comment creation, edit (10-min window), delete

### Thread Interactions (in ThreadCardComponent)
- Like/unlike with count
- Save/unsave (bookmark)
- Repost with count
- Pin/unpin (own threads)
- Delete (own threads, with confirm dialog)
- Expandable menu

### Comments (in ThreadDetailComponent)
- Create comment with reactive form
- Edit comment (inline editing, 10-min window enforced client-side)
- Delete comment with confirm
- Paginated comment loading

### Shared Services
- **ThreadService**: full CRUD, repost, quote, pin, like, unlike, react, save, unsave, report, mute, unmute, user threads, saved threads
- **CommentService**: create, list, edit, delete, report, mute, unmute
- **FeedService**: paginated feed retrieval
- **Social models**: Thread, ThreadMedia, ThreadPoll, ThreadComment, request/response types

### Routing
- Added `zones/social` route to shell, lazy-loading `SOCIAL_ZONE_ROUTES`
- `/zones/social` → Feed (auth guard)
- `/zones/social/thread/:threadId` → Thread detail (public)

### Unit Tests — 100 total (56 new)
- **ThreadService** (15): create, get, edit, delete, repost, quote, like, unlike, save, unsave, report, mute, pin, react, user threads
- **CommentService** (7): create, list, edit, delete, report, mute, unmute
- **FeedService** (3): create, get feed, page params
- **FeedComponent** (5): create, loading state, load on init, prepend on create, remove on delete
- **ThreadCardComponent** (10): create, author name, content, like count, comment count, avatar placeholder, repost badge, quote badge, timeAgo, toggle menu
- **ComposeThreadComponent** (5): create, invalid empty, valid with content, no submit invalid, max length
- **ThreadDetailComponent** (9): create, loading, empty comments, invalid comment form, valid form, no post invalid, author check, edit check, start/cancel edit

### Style Budget
- Increased `anyComponentStyle` budget to 8kB warning / 16kB error (shared social SCSS)
