## Summary

Implemented the frontend for the **User Accounts** spec using Angular 19 with MFE architecture, Tailwind CSS, and SCSS.

## Changes

### Angular Shell App
- Scaffolded Angular 19 project at `/frontend` with SCSS and routing
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 via PostCSS
- Created `NavbarComponent` — sticky nav with brand, auth-aware links (login/signup vs feed/profile/settings/logout)
- Shell `AppComponent` renders navbar + `<router-outlet>` for lazy-loaded MFEs

### Shared Library
- **Models** (`api.models.ts`): API response types, auth DTOs, user profile, privacy/security settings, follow user
- **AuthService**: signup, login, logout, refresh, password reset, localStorage token management, `currentUser$` observable
- **UserService**: profile CRUD, privacy/security settings, follow/unfollow, mute, block, report, followers/following
- **Auth interceptor**: attaches `Bearer` token to all outgoing HTTP requests
- **Auth guard / Guest guard**: route protection for authenticated and guest-only routes
- **Environment configs**: dev (localhost:8080/hotspot) and prod (/hotspot)

### User Entry MFE (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`)
- **HomeComponent**: hero section with CTA buttons, 3 feature cards (Social Zone, Privacy First, Zones)
- **LoginComponent**: reactive form with email/password validation, error handling, redirect on success
- **SignupComponent**: reactive form with email, display name, username, password, confirm password, pattern validation, password match cross-field validator

### User Profile MFE (`/profile/:username`)
- **ProfileViewComponent**: loads user profile by username, shows avatar/placeholder, display name, username, bio, location, followers/following counts, follow/unfollow button, edit profile button for own profile

### User Settings MFE (`/settings`, `/settings/privacy`, `/settings/security`)
- **SettingsProfileComponent**: edit display name, username, bio, location with save
- **SettingsPrivacyComponent**: dropdowns for profile/posts/location/phone visibility (PUBLIC/FOLLOWERS/NOBODY)
- **SettingsSecurityComponent**: toggle for 2FA with save
- All settings pages share sidebar navigation

### Routing
- Shell routes lazy-load MFE route modules:
  - `''` → User Entry MFE routes (guest guard)
  - `'profile'` → User Profile MFE routes
  - `'settings'` → User Settings MFE routes (auth guard)
- Wildcard `**` redirects to home

### Unit Tests — 44 passing
- **AppComponent** (3): create, title, renders navbar
- **NavbarComponent** (3): create, brand name, guest links
- **AuthService** (6): create, isLoggedIn states, signup stores tokens, login stores tokens, logout clears auth, password reset
- **UserService** (9): create, get profile, update profile, delete account, follow, unfollow, privacy settings, security settings, block, report
- **HomeComponent** (4): create, hero title, CTA links, feature cards
- **LoginComponent** (6): create, invalid form, require email, email format, require password, valid form, no submit when invalid
- **SignupComponent** (7): create, invalid form, require all fields, password mismatch, matching passwords, username pattern, no submit when invalid
- **ProfileViewComponent** (3): create, loading state, not own profile
- **NavbarComponent** (3): create, brand, guest links

### Backend Changes (noted)
- User added `context-path: /hotspot` to `application.yml` — frontend environment config reflects this
- User added `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency
- User removed `test` scope from H2 dependency

## Architecture Decisions
- MFE boundaries implemented as lazy-loaded Angular route modules (not Module Federation) — suitable for MVP, easy to extract later
- Shared services provided at root level (`providedIn: 'root'`) for singleton pattern
- Auth state managed via `BehaviorSubject` in `AuthService` with localStorage persistence
- Functional guards and interceptors (Angular 19 pattern) — no class-based guards
