#### Tickets

There should be a `tickets` directory at the root of the codebase - the tickets are incoming work to be done - this is optional. A ticket is can be 1 of 2 things:
- A feature request
- A bug report

Tickets should be in the format `<ticket-number>.ticket.md` and should be sorted in ascending order by ticket number. 

Each ticket should have the following format:
```markdown
---
date opened: <date-opened>
ticket: <ticket-number>
type: <ticket-type>
spec scope: <spec>

title: <ticket-title>
description: <ticket-description>

acceptance criteria:
- <acceptance-criteria>
---
```

By default, specs take priority over tickets, so if a ticket involves functionality that is not in a spec/functional requirement, it should not be implemented.
